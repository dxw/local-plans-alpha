      <p>
      Housing Delivery was on target. Housing policy has been effective at delivering the homes needed by the Borough, with 7,165 new homes delivered or 101% of its target between FY2013 and FY2017.</p>

      <p>This housing supply is made up of conventional self-contained homes which form the majority, as well as long-term empty homes returning to use and non-conventional homes such as student halls. Of the conventional supply on sites delivering ten or more units, 42% of homes were in affordable tenures.</p>

      <p>New housing has been delivered across the borough but growth is focussed in the north of the borough, in and around Central Argleton.
